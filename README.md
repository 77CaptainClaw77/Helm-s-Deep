This repository contains most of my programs, completed and some still in te process of being completed. The main purpose of this repository is to reduce redundancy by allowing me to transfer code between my personal computer and the lab computer, also to share code easily without the hassle of mailing it or sending it to everyone individually. Feel free to copy and use any and all code present in this repository.
